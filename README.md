# Mastermind Board Game

Mastermind coded in Python for the assignment of Programing Principle (CSC1024).

## Rules
1. Random generate four colours from a list of possible colours (with repetition). 
    ie. 'red', 'blue', 'red', 'green'. 
2. User guesses the four colours
3. The system returns how many colours the user got right 
    - correct color and correct position,
    - correct color but wrong position. 
4. This repeats until the user guesses correctly the four colours in the right order.
